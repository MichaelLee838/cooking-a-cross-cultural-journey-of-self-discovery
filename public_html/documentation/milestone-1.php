		<h1>Cooking: A Cross-Cultural Joureny of Self-Discovery</h1>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>My webstie will serve as way for me to share my love of cooking with others and to present a portfolio
			of the recipes I've created while cooking.</p>
		<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>The audience is fellow home chefs who seek ideas and inspiration pertaining to cooking</p>
		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>To build community around cooking- to increase the number of passionate home cooks in the United States. </p>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<h3>Name</h3>
		<p>Jeff Hernandez</p>
		<h3>Age</h3>
		<p>25</p>
		<h3>Profession</h3>
		<p>High school chemistry teacher</p>
		<h3>Technology</h3>
		<p>iphone 6, dell pc</p>
		<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
		<p>Attitudes and Behaivors: Jeff already knows about the basics of cooking, but wants to learn more.  He is studious
			by nature, so he enjoys not only glancing at cookbooks for ideas, but also learning insights into cooking.  He will
			spend time reading entire articles about various types of cuisines, such as Persian, or categories of food, such
			as pastas. </p>
		<h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
		<p>Jeff is trying to build a more muscular physique, so he’s paying much attention to the healthfulness and nutrition
			of the foods he eats.  He would like to gain 10 pounds of muscle by January.  Jeff works full time, so on weeknights,
			he doesn’t have much time to look up recipes.  He would like to be able to look at a website for at most five minutes
			before deciding on a recipe.  Also, Jeff has a few potential friends who cook, so he’s trying to learn more about the
			hobby so that he can fit in more with those individuals.  On weekends, he has more time to read articles and try
			more elaborate recipes.</p>
		<h3>Goals</h3>
		<p>Short on time during the week, jeff needs to be able to quickly identify quick, but tasty recipes to make for
			him and his boyfriend, Mark.  Jeff is also a budding home cook and would like to learn more about what it means to enjoy
			cooking more fully: the creativity involved, hosting a dinner party, trying new cuisines, telling one’s story through
			cooking.</p>
		<h3>User Story</h3>
		<p>I need to be able to quickly pick a tasty, healthy, quick recipe for a weeknight dinner and learn more about
		cooking.</p>
